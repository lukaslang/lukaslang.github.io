### Google Analytics

This website uses Google Analytics to better understand how visitors engage.
Google Analytics uses cookies to track and report website traffic and user behavior.
Google Analytics is only used with your explicit consent.
The information collected may include:
* **Pages visited:** details on the pages you view and how long you spend on them.
* **Traffic source:** information on how you arrived at our website, such as through search engines, social media, or referral links.
* **Device and browser data:** information about your device, such as its operating system, browser type, and screen resolution.

This data helps us improve the functionality, content, and user experience of our website.
We have configured Google Analytics to anonymise IP addresses, use SSL at all times, and we have agreed a Data Processing Amendment with Google. 

Google Analytics collects data anonymously and reports website trends without identifying individual visitors.
However, Google may use the data it collects for its own purposes, including advertising.
You can learn more about how Google uses data by visiting [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-US) and [Google Analytics' Terms of Service](https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/terms/us/).

If you enable browser extensions to block tracking, such as Chrome's Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on, or installed extensions to block unwanted content, such as uBlock Origin or Ghostery, the use of Google Analytics should be denied as well.
