I have decided to finally redesign my website and to start a blog.

In this first post I explain why I start writing, what I will write about, and for whom I intend to write. I will try to ease my posts a bit with pictures I took over the last couple of years.

### Why do I write?

**To communicate.**
Writing is a powerful form of communication.
Being able to convey precise ideas or information in just as many words as necessary is a superpower.

**To learn.**
Writing is difficult -- at least for me.
Even though I have written several theses, articles, and papers, I would like to improve my skills.
Most importantly, I aim to improve the iterative process I typically follow to get from a first ideas to a finished post that is good enough to be published.
I would like to converge faster.

In addition, I'm a very curious person, and I like exploring and learning new things.
Taking the time to distill and summarise key pieces of information in concise form is a good way to understand material and to memorise things long-term.

**To think.**
The act of writing helps me to concentrate and forces me to formulate thoughts and ideas with high precision and clarity.
Especially, with outside chatter being suppressed.

**To grow.**
I discovered that writing is a form of investment in my future self.
I have started to take notes during almost every meeting, document all my code and projects in great detail.
In addition, I often write summaries of, for example, papers or books I have read.
This not only helps me to persists information in a way that I (and potentially others) can quickly access in the future, but also allows me to identify gaps in my understanding and typically raises a lot of interesting questions to pursue.

Finally, I simply find pleasure in the act of writing.

### What will I write about?

I intend to cover a broad range of topics, some of which will be technical, some non-technical.
However, most posts will be related in some way to maths, data science, and machine learning.

For a list of potential topics see my [idea storage](/topics).
Feel free to get in touch and suggest topics you would be interested in.

### Whom will I write for?

For the reasons outlined above, I mainly write for my current and future self.
Nevertheless, I hope that one or the other curious visitor, current, or future co-worker will enjoy reading my posts, take away some useful insights, and maybe even share them.

### How often will I publish?

I have not set any personal goals (yet) and I will have to see how much time I can dedicate to writing.

### What about feedback?

I generally try to have an open mind about feedback, so feel free to get in touch and let me know your thoughts.
Having said this, I will only consider constructive feedback and will only engage in well-intended and fact-based discussions.

### How did I set up this website?

It is based on Jekyll, the [Contrast](https://github.com/niklasbuschmann/contrast) theme, and is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/lukaslang/lukaslang.github.io).
I wanted a rather simple setup which matches my daily workflow (git), and that I can easily adjust with my very limited HTML/CSS knowledge.
As you can see, I heavily modified the theme to match my preferences.
